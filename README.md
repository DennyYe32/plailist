Project Information
Project Title: plAIlist
Team Members: Denny Ye, Jackson Hamilton, Katie Dao, Brendon Beltran
Tier Level: [Intermediate]

Project Description: We developed an interactive website that allows web users to create a playlist of 25 songs based on keywords that they provide. Keywords provided can range from music genres, music artists, emotions, or anything the user imagines. The keywords are then sent to the openAI API through a POST request, and a sample playlist, sent back by the openAI API, is then displayed to the user. The user is then asked if they would like to sign in to Spotify to create a new playlist based on the response provided by openAI.

Public Frameworks Utilized: openAI-API, Next.js, Three.js, React, HTML, CSS, Typescript, REST-API

Friday
Welcome to UGAHacksX! We’re excited that you’re participating and revving up for an amazing weekend! Today will be short, but we advise you to settle on a project and create a plan to guide you! Already have something in mind? Now’s a great time to get started!

    Goals:
        Goal 1: Create demo search query for AI (OpenAI)
        Goal 2: Learn and research OpenAI api
        Goal 3: Learn and research Spotify api
        Goal 4: Learn and research three.js


    Progress:
        7:00pm (All): Brainstormed ideas and settled on Plailist
        8:00pm (All): Installed necessary frameworks
        9:00pm (All): Research
        10:00pm (Bren): Designed logo for Plailist

    Challenges:
        1. Challenge 1: We faced a problem with the gitHub repository not publishing right.
            - Solution (if found): We used VsCode GitHub extension to publish the right files.

Saturday
Saturday is the longest day of the Hackathon! The bulk of your project will get done within today, so set your goals wisely!

    Goals:
        Goal 1: Complete front-end
        Goal 2: Complete Open-AI implementation
        Goal 3: Complete Spotify AI Implementation

    Progress: (Describe what was accomplished)
        12:00am (Denny / Jackson): At the moment, we have created a working react prototype website with all the modules/packages installed.
        1:04am (Katie): Created a webpage with a scroll trigger using GSAP.js, a JavaScript library for scrolling animations.
        2:00am (Katie): Added cylinder for the base of the drum model.
        9:03am (Katie): Added background gradient, text box, click icon, 3D drum, floating music notes, second page, second icon to spotify link.
        1:00pm (Bren): Changed font
        3:30pm (Bren): Updated favicon
        4:00pm (Jackson / Denny): Accomplished requesting openAI call.
        4:30pm (Jackson / Denny): Accomplished displaying openAI response

    Challenges:
        1. Challenge 1: Creating the openAI call
            - Solution (if found): We realized that the call cannot be used within a component. We created an api/create-playlist/route.ts folder to hold our calls.
        2. Challenge 2: We had trouble displaying the openAI response from a different page.
            - Solution (if found): We created all the code on one single page.


    Learning:
        (List key concepts or skills learned)
            Learned some of GSAP.js library
            Learned API calls
            Learned openAI Api
