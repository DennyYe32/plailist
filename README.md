Friday
Welcome to UGAHacksX! We’re excited that you’re participating and revving up for an amazing weekend! Today will be short, but we advise you to settle on a project and create a plan to guide you! Already have something in mind? Now’s a great time to get started!

    Goals:
        Goal 1: Create demo search query for AI (OpenAI)
        Goal 2: Learn and research OpenAI api
        Goal 3: Learn and research Spotify api
        Goal 4: Learn and research three.js


    Progress:
        7:00pm (All): Brainstormed ideas and settled on Plailist
        8:00pm (All): Installed necessary frameworks
        9:00pm (All): Research
        10:00pm (Bren): Designed logo for Plailist

    Challenges:
        1. Challenge 1: We faced a problem with the gitHub repository not publishing right.
            - Solution (if found): We used VsCode GitHub extension to publish the right files.
        2. Challenge 2:
            - Solution (if found):

Saturday
Saturday is the longest day of the Hackathon! The bulk of your project will get done within today, so set your goals wisely!

    Goals:
        Goal 1: Complete front-end
        Goal 2: Complete Open-AI implementation
        Goal 3: Complete Spotify AI Implementation

    Progress: (Describe what was accomplished)
        12:00am (Denny / Jackson): At the moment, we have created a working react prototype website with all the modules/packages installed.
        1:04am (Katie): Created a webpage with a scroll trigger using GSAP.js, a JavaScript library for scrolling animations.
        2:00am (Katie): Added cylinder for the base of the drum model.
        9:03am (Katie): Added background gradient, text box, click icon, 3D drum, floating music notes, second page, second icon to spotify link.
        1:00pm (Bren): Changed font
        3:30pm (Bren): Updated favicon
        4:00pm (Jackson / Denny): Accomplished requesting openAI call.
        4:30pm (Jackson / Denny): Accomplished displaying openAI response

    Challenges:
        1. Challenge 1: Creating the openAI call
            - Solution (if found): We realized that the call cannot be used within a component. We created an api/create-playlist/route.ts folder to hold our calls.
        2. Challenge 2: We had trouble displaying the openAI response from a different page.
            - Solution (if found): We created all the code on one single page.


    Learning:
        (List key concepts or skills learned)
            Learned some of GSAP.js library
            Learned API calls
            Learned openAI Api
